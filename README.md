# Tech-Assessment-Weather-App
This project is split into two levels. At first I've built a weather app that will take in user-input and then gather data from outside sources (API retrieval) to provide the user with relevant real-time information based on their requests. Second focuses on persistence with CRUD functionality as well as additional API calls and error handling.
